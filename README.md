## Other Details

### Important source files

All the sources referred to are under `src/main/java/com/shyamanand/fileupload`.

#### web.controllers.FilesController controller

This class defines the REST endpoints to receive requests for uploading the files, and for the video URL. This depends on the `FileStorage` interface 
to store and retrieve files.

#### storage.FileStorage interface

This interface declares method to store, retrieve and delete files.

#### storage.filesystem.FileSystemStorage

This class implements `storage.FileStorage` and defines methods to store and retrieve files on the local filesystem.

### Receiving video file in chunks

The endpoint `/files/parts` accepts `POST` requests with a part of the file, and the checksum for the original file.

A subdirectory is created for the file, with the checksum as the directory name. All the parts for the file is stored under this dir. On receiving a `GET`
request on `/files/{checksum}` the file parts under the `{checksum}` directory are joined. This will return the path to the combined file.


### Playback 

The endpoint `/files/play/{filename}` returns the video file. This endpoint can be used as the `src` for rendering the `<video>` element in the front-end.
